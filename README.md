our java code for the 2024 season! 
this year we are using a [Swerve Drive Specialties MK4i](https://www.swervedrivespecialties.com/products/mk4i-swerve-module) drive base, with 8 [Falcon 500](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/falcon-500-powered-by-talon-fx/) motors. 
our base code is derived from [this example swerve code](https://github.com/dirtbikerxz/BaseTalonFXSwerve)

## Play Structure
Our robot is designed to be a fast cycle, floor pickup, and speaker shooting bot. We are (planning) on using a 4 bar extension with 2 pairs of bars with 2 inch compliant wheels as our intake. The intake will directly feed to our launcher, which will have 2 pairs of wheels connected with a belt. The launcher itself will be variable angle, allowing us to be able to shoot from up close, and afar. We will have a camera on the front of the launcher to see the april tags on the speaker, and will use auto alignment to shoot.
